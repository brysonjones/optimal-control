# optimal-control
This repo is a place for the development and testing of different implementations of optimal control algorithms (MPC, iLQR, etc)

## Tools
* Simulation: PyBullet
* Autodiff: 
* Optimization Solver: 
* Python Bindings: 

## Open Questions:
* When wrapping the C++ controllers into python code, whats the best
  way to communicate matrix/vector values
    * i.e. handling conversion from numpy arrays to Eigen matrices
